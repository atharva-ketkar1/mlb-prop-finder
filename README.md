## Overview
This repository is used to predict PrizePicks pitcher props (Strikeouts, Fantasy Score, Earned Runs). Right now because it is an initial implementation, it will only attempt to predict Strikeouts.

Already got a 10$ minimum on PrizePicks for discounted projections. Up a few hundred dollars currently, I will update this as I continue to test and improve the model.
